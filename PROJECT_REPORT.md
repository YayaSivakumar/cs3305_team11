## Lessons Learned
The project provided many opportunities to learn new skills and techniques. The following are some of the lessons learned:


## Conclusion
Users often find that over time, their file systems become cluttered and disorganized. This project aims to provide a solution to this problem by providing a file system node structure that is easy to navigate and understand. 

The project has been successful in achieving this goal and has provided a valuable resource for users.

## Future Work
The project has provided a solid foundation for future work. The following are some of the areas that could be explored in future work:
- Greater integration with other systems
- Improved user interface
- Enhanced security features
- More advanced file system node structure


## Acknowledgements
