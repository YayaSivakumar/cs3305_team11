'''In mainwindow.py, create the main window with a sidebar.
In the sidebar's slot method, change the displayed widget
in the QStackedWidget based on the user's choice.'''


# This is the central window that includes the sidebar and the area where primary windows will be displayed.
# Use a QStackedWidget or QStackedLayout to manage the primary windows.
# This allows you to stack the different windows on top of each other and switch between them.
# The sidebar can be implemented using QListWidget or QToolBar,
# with each item or button connected to a slot that changes the displayed widget in the QStackedWidget.
