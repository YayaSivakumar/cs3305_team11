        The File System Organiser is an advanced tool designed to streamline and enhance the organization and management
        of files on your computer. With our internal file system node model, once the file system is scanned it is
        cached and is loaded with each start up. Our model facilitates the searching of files and access of metadata from
        files without the need to address the file directly. This comprehensive solution offers a range of
        functionalities aimed at simplifying the way that users sort, store and share their digital content, making it
        an indispensable tool for both personal and professional use.
